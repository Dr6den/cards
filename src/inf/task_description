Code test:

1. Create a new project in JavaFX.

2. Build 1 binary version for Windows (.exe) and one for Android (.apk)

3. Make a poker table, see attached image resources. Deal from a deck, out to the 5 slots on the table.
 Use animations in a platform independent way in 2D canvas or similar.
 The cards should be animated with the cards backside up, when the card has reached the card slot at the table 
it should be rotated to show the card. The cards should be dealt randomly from the deck, and from the 52 cards. 
It should not be possible to see the same card twice on the table. The card deck should be located in the upper center part 
just outside the table. The total animation time should be 2 seconds, that is for moving the card to the slot, then rotation.
